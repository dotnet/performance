This repo contains benchmarks used for testing the performance of all .NET Runtimes: .NET Core, Full .NET Framework, Mono and CoreRT.

Finding these benchmarks in a separate repository might be surprising. Performance in a given scenario may be impacted by changes in seemingly unrelated components. Using this central repository ensures that measurements are made in comparable ways across all .NET runtimes and repos. This consistency lets engineers make progress and ensures the customer scenarios are protected.
