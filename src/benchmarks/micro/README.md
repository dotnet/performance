# Micro Benchmarks

This folder contains micro benchmarks that test the performance of .NET Runtime(s).

## Tooling

To run the benchmarks, you need to download dotnet cli or use the python script, please see [Prerequisites](../../../docs/prerequisites.md) for more.

We use BenchmarkDotNet as the benchmarking tool, you can read more about it in [our short summary](../../../docs/benchmarkdotnet.md) (it's recommended). The key thing that you need to remember is that **BenchmarkDotNet runs every benchmark in a dedicated process and stops the benchmarking when a specified level of precision is met**.

To learn more about designing benchmarks, please read [Microbenchmark Design Guidelines](../../../docs/microbenchmark-design-guidelines.md).

## Quick Start

The first thing that you need to choose is the Target Framework. Available options are: `netcoreapp2.1|netcoreapp3.1|netcoreapp5.0|net461`. You can specify the target framework using `-f|--framework` argument. For the sake of simplicity, all examples below use `netcoreapp5.0` as the target framework.

The following commands are run from the `src/benchmarks/micro` directory.

To run the benchmarks in Interactive Mode, where you will be asked which benchmark(s) to run:

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp5.0
```

To list all available benchmarks ([read more](../../../docs/benchmarkdotnet.md#Listing-the-Benchmarks)):

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp5.0 --list flat|tree
```

To filter the benchmarks using a glob pattern applied to namespace.typeName.methodName ([read more](../../../docs/benchmarkdotnet.md#Filtering-the-Benchmarks)):

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp5.0 --filter *Span*
```

To profile the benchmarked code and produce an ETW Trace file ([read more](../../../docs/benchmarkdotnet.md#Profiling)):

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp5.0 --filter $YourFilter --profiler ETW
```

To run the benchmarks for multiple runtimes ([read more](../../../docs/benchmarkdotnet.md#Multiple-Runtimes)):

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp3.1 --filter * --runtimes netcoreapp3.1 netcoreapp5.0 corert
```

## Private Runtime Builds

If you contribute to [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) and want to benchmark **local builds of .NET Core** you need to build [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) in Release (including tests) and then provide the path(s) to CoreRun(s). Provided CoreRun(s) will be used to execute every benchmark in a dedicated process:

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp3.1 --filter $YourFilter \
    --corerun C:\Projects\runtime\artifacts\bin\testhost\net5.0-Windows_NT-Release-x64\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\5.0.0\CoreRun.exe
```

To make sure that your changes don't introduce any regressions, you can provide paths to CoreRuns with and without your changes and use the Statistical Test feature to detect regressions/improvements ([read more](../../../docs/benchmarkdotnet.md#Regressions)):

```cmd
dotnet run -c Release -f netcoreapp3.1 \
    --filter BenchmarksGame* \
    --statisticalTest 3ms \
    --coreRun \
        "C:\Projects\runtime_upstream\artifacts\bin\testhost\net5.0-Windows_NT-Release-x64\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\5.0.0\CoreRun.exe" \
        "C:\Projects\runtime_fork\artifacts\bin\testhost\net5.0-Windows_NT-Release-x64\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\5.0.0\CoreRun.exe"
```

If you **prefer to use dotnet cli** instead of CoreRun, you need to pass the path to cli via the `--cli` argument.

BenchmarkDotNet allows you to run the benchmarks for private builds of [Full .NET Framework](../../../docs/benchmarkdotnet.md#Private-CLR-Build) and [CoreRT](../../../docs/benchmarkdotnet.md#Private-CoreRT-Build)

We once again encourage you to read the [full docs about BenchmarkDotNet](../../../docs/benchmarkdotnet.md#table-of-contents).

### Categories

Every micro benchmark should belong to either Runtime, Libraries or ThirdParty category. It allows for filtering by category.

Adding given type/method to particular category requires using a `[BenchmarkCategory]` attribute:

```cs
[BenchmarkCategory(Categories.Libraries)]
public class SomeType
```

### Enabling given benchmark(s) for selected Operating System(s)

This is possible with the `AllowedOperatingSystemsAttribute`. You need to provide a mandatory comment and OS(es) that benchmark(s) can run on.

```cs
[AllowedOperatingSystems("Hangs on non-Windows, dotnet/corefx#18290", OS.Windows)]
public class Perf_PipeTest
```
