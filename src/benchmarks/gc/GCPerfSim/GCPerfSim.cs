/*
 * This is a simulator for managed memory behaviors to test the GC performance. It has the following aspects:

1) It provides general things you'd want to do when testing perf, eg, # of threads, running time, allocated bytes.

2) It includes different building blocks to simulate different relevant behaviors for GC, eg, survival rates,
   flat or pointer-rich object graphs, different SOH/LOH ratio.
   
The idea is when we see a relevant behavior we want this simulator to be able to generate that behavior but we
also want to have a dial (ie, how intense that behavior is) and mix it with other behaviors.

Each run writes out a log named pid-output.txt that includes some general info such as parameters used and execution time.



Right now it's fairly simple - during initialization it allocates an array that holds onto byte 
arrays that are placed on SOH and LOH based on the alloc ratio given; and during steady state it 
allocates byte arrays and survives based on survival intervals given.

It has the following characteristics:

It has a very flat object graph and very simple lifetime. It's a simple test that's good for things that
mostly just care about # of bytes allocated/promoted like BGC scheduling.

It allows you to specify the following commandline args. Notes on commandline args -

1) they are NOT case sensitive;

2) always specify a number as the value for an arg. For boolean values use 1 for true and 0 for false.

3) if you want to still specify an arg but want to use the default (Why? Maybe you want to run this with a lot of different
configurations and it's easier to compare if you have all the configs specified), just specify something that can't be parsed
as an integer. For example you could specify "defArgName". That way you could replace all defArgName with a value if you needed.

-testKind/-tk: testKind
    Either "time" (default) or "highsurvival"
    For "highsurvival", -totalMins should be set, -sohSurvInterval and -lohSurvInterval should not

-threadCount/-tc: threadCount
allocating thread count (usually I use half of the # of CPUs on the machine, this is just to reduce the OS scheduler effect 
so we can test the GC effect better)

-lohAllocRatio/-lohar: lohAllocRatio
LOH alloc ratio (this controls the bytes we allocate on LOH out of all allocations we do)
It's in in per thousands (not percents! even though in the output it says %). So if it's 5, that means 
5‰ of the allocations will be on LOH.

-pohAllocRatio/-pohar: pohAllocRatio
(.NET 5.0 or later)
POH alloc ratio (this controls the bytes we allocate on POH out of all allocations we do)
It's in in per thousands (not percents! even though in the output it says %). So if it's 5, that means 
5‰ of the allocations will be on POH.

-totalLiveGB/-tlgb: totalLiveBytesGB
this is the total live data size in GB

-totalAllocGB/-tagb: totalAllocBytesGB
this is the total allocated size in GB, instead of accepting an arg like # of iterations where you don't really know what 
an iteration does, we use the allocated bytes to indicate how much work the threads do.

-requestAllocMB/-ramb: requestAllocBytes
this is used to simulate "request processing" in servers. we allocate this much and keep a fraction of it live 
until we've reached the total. Then we let go of all the objects allocated for this request. Multiple threads
may be working in parallel on separate requests. The idea is to keep a certain amount of memory live for requests in flight.
for the GC, this creates objects with an intermediate lifetime, so the percentage of surviving objects in gen 1 goes
down (otherwise, it would be very close to 100%, because most objects would either die in gen 0, or survive long enough so they
get promoted to gen 2).

-requestLiveMB/-rlmb: requestLiveBytes
how much memory to keep live during a request.

-reqSohSurvInterval/-rsohsi:
meaning every Nth SOH object allocated during a request survives

-reqLohSurvInterval/-rlohsi":
meaning every Nth LOH object allocated during a request survives

-reqPohSurvInterval/-rpohsi":
(.NET 5.0 or later)
meaning every Nth POH object allocated during a request survives

-totalMins/-tm: totalMinutesToRun
time to run in minutes (for things that need long term effects like scheduling you want to run for 
a while, eg, a few hours to see how stable it is)

Note that if neither -totalAllocMB nor -totalMins is specified, it will run for the default for -totalMins.
If both are specified, we take whichever one that's met first. 

-sohSizeRange/-sohsr: sohAllocLow, sohAllocHigh
eg: -sohSizeRange 100-4000 will set sohAllocLow and sohAllocHigh to 100 and 4000
we allocate SOH that's randomly chosen between this range.

-lohSizeRange/-lohsr: lohAllocLow, lohAllocHigh
we allocate LOH that's randomly chosen between this range.

-pohSizeRange/-pohsr: pohAllocLow, pohAllocHigh
(.NET 5.0 or later)
we allocate POH that's randomly chosen between this range.

-sizeDistribution/-sizeDist: 1/0
1 means use the built-in size distributions to generate bucket specs
0 (default) means generate simple ones from values (or defaults) for -sohsr and related arguments

-sohSurvInterval/-sohsi: sohSurvInterval
meaning every Nth SOH object allocated will survive. This is something we will consider changing to survival rate
later. When the allocated objects are of similar sizes the surv rate is 1/sohSurvInterval but we may not want them
to all be similar sizes.

-lohSurvInterval/-lohsi: lohSurvInterval
meaning every Nth LOH object allocated will survive. 

-pohSurvInterval/-pohsi:
(.NET 5.0 or later)
meaning every Nth POH object allocated will survive.

Note that -sohSurvInterval/-lohSurvInterval are only applicable for steady state.
During initialization everything survives.

-sohPinningInterval/-sohpi: sohPinningInterval
meaning every Nth SOH object survived will be pinned. 

-sohFinalizableInterval/-sohfi: sohFinalizableInterval
meaning every Nth SOH object survived will be finalizable.

-lohPinningInterval/-lohpi: lohPinningInterval
meaning every Nth LOH object survived will be pinned. 

-lohFinalizableInterval/-lohfi: lohFinalizableInterval
meaning every Nth LOH object survived will be finalizable.

-pohFinalizableInterval/-pohfi: pohFinalizableInterval
(.NET 5.0 or later)
meaning every Nth POH object survived will be finalizable.

-allocType/-at: allocType
What kind of objects are we allocating? Current supported types: 
0 means SimpleItem - a byte array (implemented by the Item class)
1 means ReferenceItem - contains refs and can form linked list (implemented by the ReferenceItemWithSize class)

-verifyLiveSize: 1/0
Perform some verification that the live object size matches the expected size

-printEveryNthIter: printEveryNthIter
Display a summary every N iterations

-handleTest - NOT IMPLEMENTED other than pinned handles. Should write some interesting cases for weak handles.

-lohPauseMeasure/-lohpm: lohPauseMeasure
measure the time it takes to do a LOH allocation. When turned on the top 10 longest pauses will be included in the log file.
TODO: The longest pauses are interesting but we should also include all pauses by pause buckets.

-endException/-ee: endException
induces an exception at the end so you can do some post mortem debugging.

-compute/-c: Do some extra computation between allocations, 1000 will reduce the allocation rate by a factor of 2-4

-finishWithFullCollect: Do collections until all allocated finalizable objects have been finalized

The default for these args are specified in "Default parameters".

---

Other things worth noting:

1) There's also a lohPauseMeasure var that you could make into a config - for now I just always measure pauses for LOH 
   allocs (since it was used for measuring LOH alloc pause wrt BGC sweep).

2) At the end of the test I do an EmptyWorkingSet - the reason for this is when I run the test in a loop if I don't 
   empty the WS for an iteration it's common to observe that it heavily affects the beginning of the next iteration.


For perf runs I usually run with GC internal logging on which means I'd want to get the last (in memory) part of the log 
at the end. So this provides a config that make it convenient for that purpose by intentionally inducing an exception at 
the end so you can get the last part of the logging by setting this

   for your post mortem debugging in the registry: 
   under HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug 
   you can add a reg value called Debugger of REG_SZ type and it should be
   "d:\debuggers\amd64\windbg" -p %ld -e %ld -c ".jdinfo 0x%p; !DumpGCLog c:\temp;q"
   (obviously make sure the directory for windbg is correct for the machine you run the test on and
   replace c:\temp with whatever directory that you want to put the last part of the log in)

This is by default off and can be turned on via the -endException/-ee config.

**********************************************************************************************************************

When working on this please KEEP THE FOLLOWING IN MIND:

1) Do not use anything fancier than needed. In other words, use very simple code in this project. I am not against 
   using cool/rich lang/framework features normally but for this purpose we want something that's as easy to reason about 
   as possible, eg, using things like linq is forbidden because you don't know how much allocations/survivals it 
   does and even if you do understand perfectly (which is doubtful) it might change and it's a burden for other 
   people who need to work on this. 
   
2) Clearly document your intentions for each building block you write. This is important for others because a building
   block is supposed to be easy to use so in general another person shouldn't need to understand how the code works
   in order to use it. For example, if a building block is supposed to allocate X bytes with Y links (where the user
   specifies X and Y) it should say that in the comments.

3) Only add new files if there's a good reason to. Do NOT create tons of little files.
